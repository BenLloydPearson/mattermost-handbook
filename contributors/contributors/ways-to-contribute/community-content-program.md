# The Mattermost Community Content Program

Mattermost wants to be a central resource for helping developers improve their productivity. To that end, we want to open our blog to our diverse community to share expertise, tips and tricks, guides, and other technical resources that help developers get work done. We’ll compensate authors whenever we publish their content.


## About You

We’re looking for a diverse group of skilled writers with deep technical knowledge to write content for us. You should have experience writing content, be comfortable receiving feedback about your work, and be open to making revisions recommended by our editorial team.


## Recommended Topics

We seek a broad range of technical content for software developers that provide rich detail about popular tools. We typically want content that targets beginner to intermediate software developers, but we are open to a range of technical depth.



* How to use popular app frameworks like Node, React, Vue, Flask, Kotlin, etc.
* Software development productivity hacks.
* Tips and tricks for popular software development tools.
* Unique DevOps infrastructure at scale.
* Introductions to useful libraries, programming environments, languages, and tech stacks.


## Compensation

Most authors receive $250 - $350 for publishing unique content, but exceptionally detailed content about prevalent technologies can earn up to $500. We also run regular events that offer bonuses for writing about specific topics.


## The Process



1. **Submit Your Idea** - Submit your idea via our [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaydlRPSA5U8S0_6JYBOpnA1762t0irWLO-AYsvahPRLzZMA/viewform) with an outline of your content and a previous writing example demonstrating your technical knowledge and writing capabilities. We will only publish unique, first-run content where our blog is the first platform for it to be published.
2. **Refine** - Our editorial team will reach out to you to provide feedback on the idea and make any structural changes requests.
3. **Write your content** - Once we’ve approved your topic, it’s time to write the content. We'll provide additional guidelines and expectations to help you get started, but generally speaking, following Digital Ocean's [technical writing guidelines](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines) is a good plan.
4. **Revise** - Submit your initial draft to our editors, and we’ll collaborate with you to copyedit, design a hero image, and prepare the article for publication. You should 1-2 rounds of revisions over the next 1-2 weeks.
5. **Publish** - Once revisions are complete, we’ll send your compensation, publish the article, and promote it across all of our channels.
6. **Do it Again** - There’s no limit to the number of articles you can publish through this program. We love to build long-term relationships with our community and would love for you to be a repeat author on our blog. Start at step 1 again and keep going!


## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I get involved?**

Review our [process for submitting ideas](#the-process). When you submit a new idea, we’re going to ask you for details like:

* The article title and a summary of its contents.
* An outline of your article with descriptions about what each section of the article will cover
* Information about prerequisite knowledge the reader will need to have
* A link to a previous writing sample that demonstrates your capabilities.

Our editorial staff will reach out to let you know if we want to publish your content and will make recommendations for revisions. Once we’ve agreed that we’re happy with the idea, we’ll send you a contract that agrees on the scope of the article and the compensation. From there, it’s up to you to write the first draft and submit it for review!

**How do you evaluate content ideas?**

Our team reviews every submission, and we look for technical content that comprehensively covers software development topics with clear explanations. Explain as much detail as possible and leave no concepts out.
